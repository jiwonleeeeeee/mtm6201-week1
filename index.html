            <p>My name is Jiwon Lee. I have immigrated to Canada from South Korea. I used to live in Manitoba, but in 2021, I ended up moving to Ottawa. I decided to settle down here and enrolled in Algonquin college. I am taking Interactive Media Design program in Algonquin College. I am interested in graphic design, UX design, and I also feel web development is interesting. My short-term goal during this program is to learn new skills and to experience what I've never done before from the professional teachers and peers. In the end of my study, I want to find a job by achieving academic success based on learning and experience.</p>
